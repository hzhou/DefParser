# DefParser
LL(*) Top Down Parser Generator in MyDef

I am abandoning/transforming this project. 

It is not that is too difficult, but I came to realize that is not what I want. An automated parser still leaves the burden of writing syntax and walking the AST to the programmer and it turns out the AST walking is not trivial. 
I want something more intuitive.
